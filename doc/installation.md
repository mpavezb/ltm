# Installation instructions

The LTM system was developed under ROS kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04. The only dependencies are the following:

- Python and C++ standard lbraries.
- MongoDB server and driver for C++.

Also, the `ltm_addons` package depends on the SMACH ROS packages.

These dependencies can be installed using: 

```(bash)
$ roscd ltm
$ bash install/install.bash
```
