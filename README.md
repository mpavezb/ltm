# LTM - Long Term Memory for Robots

Long Term Memory for robots using ROS. Thesis project.

## Overview

The episodic LTM (EpLTM) is a very relevant challenge for service robotics, it allows us to enhance human-robot interaction (HRI), robot understanding about the environment, and the way in which it can handle tasks. This repository holds the ROS implementation code for the LTM project developed by Mat√≠as Pavez in his final C.Sc and E.E Thesis. See also [the thesis repository](https://github.com/mpavezb/memoria).


This projects provides a LTM implementation with Episodic, Semantic and Emotional components. It is built on ROS, KnowRob and SMACH. ROS works as the robotics framework which enables the communication between robot components. KnowRob serves as a cognition framework, it provides semantic memory and inference mechanisms. SMACH allow us to gather episodes from the state machine point of view.
